The Sales Dashboard provides a convenient interface for users to monitor the current sales performance of salespeople. Additionally, it offers functionality to add new employees along with their respective sales targets and current sales figures.

## Features: 

- View current sales performance of salespeople.
- Add new employees with sales targets and current sales figures.
- It uses the library colorama to give an indication of top performers.

## Data Models 
- The Sales Dashboard's data model encompasses entities such as Employees, Sales, and Targets. 
- Within this model, each Employee record comprises essential details like name, ID, and assigned sales target. 
- Sales records encapsulate specific sale information, including the transaction amount and date. 
- Targets records maintain the predefined sales objectives for individual employees.

## Flowchart
